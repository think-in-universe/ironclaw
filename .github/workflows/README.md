# CI Contract

This directory implements a tiered CI contract. Each tier has a distinct job;
a check belongs to exactly one tier on purpose.

| Tier | Event | Job |
|---|---|---|
| PR feedback | `pull_request` | Fast, scoped signal for the author. May run slim matrices and path-scoped subsets. |
| **Production gate** | `merge_group` (merge queue) | The authority on what reaches `main`. Runs deterministic checks in the **same shape as push** on the merged state. |
| Post-merge confirm | `push` to `main` | Confirms the queue's verdict, warms shared caches, feeds Codecov/canaries. Should never be the first place a deterministic failure appears. |
| Deep / scheduled | `schedule` (nightly) | Exhaustive suites too slow for the queue: legacy v1 matrix, full browser E2E, stress scans. |

## The invariant

**No deterministic failure may be main-only.** If a check runs deterministically
on `push` to main, the merge queue must run it in the same shape first
(`merge_group` does not support `paths:` filters — use a `changes` scope job
instead). External/live checks (canaries, deploys, releases, benchmark
thresholds) are exempt: they stay out of the queue by design.

The WASM WIT compatibility lane uses two risk scopes. Pull requests run it only
for direct WIT, WASM host, extension, compatibility-test, or lane-workflow
changes. Root `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` changes are broader workspace risk:
they run the lane in the merge queue, before landing, without adding the full
WASM build to ordinary PR feedback. Push and deep-CI runs remain exhaustive.

History: the slim-vs-full clippy matrix violated this — the queue linted only
`--all-features` while push linted `all-features`/`default`/`libsql-only`, so
feature-gated dead code (e.g. a `#[cfg(feature = "postgres")]`-constructed enum
variant) passed the queue and turned main red post-merge.

## Required checks and where they're enforced

Branch enforcement lives in the repository **ruleset "Main"** (Settings → Rules
→ Rulesets), *not* classic branch protection — the classic API reports
`required_status_checks: null`. Inspect the effective rules with:

```bash
gh api repos/nearai/ironclaw/rules/branches/main
```

The ruleset enables the merge queue and requires these check contexts (stable
roll-up **job names**, never individual matrix jobs):

| Check context (job name) | Workflow | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `Code Style (fmt + clippy)` | `code_style.yml` | required |
| `Tests (Reborn)` | `reborn-tests.yml` | required |
| `Reborn E2E` | `reborn-e2e.yml` | candidate — require once queue cost is confirmed |
| `Platform & Compat` | `platform-and-compat.yml` | candidate — require once queue cost is confirmed |

Rules for a roll-up job that is (or may become) required:

1. Trigger on `merge_group` and report on every run (`if: always()`), so the
   queue never waits on a check that will never arrive.
2. Tolerate `skipped` only for jobs that are event- or scope-gated by design;
   anything that ran must have succeeded.
3. Assert expected coverage where feasible — the Code Style roll-up fails if a
   merge-queue/push run's clippy matrix is missing any of the three feature
   lanes, so a "green but slim" regression cannot come back silently.

## Reborn release binary compile matrix

`reborn-release-compile.yml` is the compile-and-smoke matrix for the shipping
Reborn `ironclaw` binary. The tag-only `release.yml` calls it for matching
release tags, then packages those matrix outputs into a GitHub Release through
the Reborn-specific `publish-reborn-binaries` job. The reusable preflight
workflow can also run directly through `workflow_dispatch`; direct dispatch only
uploads temporary evidence artifacts and does not publish a release. It is not
triggered by pull requests, so ordinary CLI and WebUI changes do not start the
seven-platform release matrix.

| Rust target | GitHub runner |
|---|---|
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `ubuntu-22.04` |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` | `ubuntu-22.04` |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` |
| `x86_64-apple-darwin` | `macos-15-intel` |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | `macos-15` |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | `windows-2022` |

Each matrix entry performs a final `cargo build --locked --profile dist` link
for `ironclaw_reborn_cli` / `ironclaw` with an explicit compile feature
contract owned by this workflow:
`libsql,postgres,inmemory-turn-state`.
Before upload, the workflow executes that exact native binary with `--version`,
`--help`, and `profile list --json`. The musl entries also use `readelf` to
reject a program interpreter or dynamic-library dependency, which prevents an
installed musl loader on the build runner from hiding a non-portable artifact.
This is shallow CLI startup coverage; it does not validate `serve`, external
services, installers, or cargo-dist release packaging. The feature list is
intentionally not inferred from Docker or #6122.

The uploaded `reborn-compile-*` artifacts are the handoff from the compile
matrix to `release.yml`'s Reborn publisher. On tag pushes, the publisher
downloads them, emits per-target `ironclaw-<target>.tar.gz` assets plus
per-asset `.sha256` files and `sha256.sum`, and creates or updates the GitHub
Release for the tag. Until #3483 defines the canonical Reborn package/tag/
installer contract, `ironclaw_reborn_cli` remains `dist = false` and these
archives are intentionally produced outside cargo-dist.

## Deep tier (nightly)

`nightly-deep-ci.yml` (04:00 UTC) reuses `platform-and-compat.yml`,
`reborn-tests.yml`, and `reborn-e2e.yml` via `workflow_call` at full scope.
The legacy v1 suite (`test.yml`) is deliberately not invoked — see the
freeze note in `nightly-deep-ci.yml`. Two hard-won gotchas are encoded in
the configuration:

- **`github.event_name` in a reusable workflow is the caller's event** — it is
  never `workflow_call`. Conditions written as `github.event_name ==
  'workflow_call'` silently skip when invoked from nightly (this hid the
  Windows/bench/docker deep coverage). Called workflows use the `deep` marker
  input instead: it defaults to true and only materializes under
  `workflow_call`.
- **A called workflow that references `secrets.*` needs `secrets: inherit` at
  the call site.** Otherwise the entire caller run dies at trigger time as a
  `startup_failure` with zero jobs — including any in-run alert job. Nightly
  Deep CI had zero successful runs from its creation (2026-05-06) through
  2026-07-08 — 65 of its 74 retained runs are startup_failures — precisely
  because this failure mode is invisible from inside the run.
  `nightly-watchdog.yml` (08:00 UTC) exists for exactly that: it checks each
  nightly's latest scheduled run from outside and posts the failure to Slack
  even when the run itself never started.

### Nightly alerting

One path only: `nightly-watchdog.yml` (08:00 UTC) checks the latest scheduled
run of each nightly — Nightly Deep CI, Reborn Playwright, IronClaw Stress. A
run that is missing, stale (>26h: the cron didn't fire),
or concluded anything but success posts a failure line (workflow, conclusion,
failed job names, run link) to the Slack channel behind
`secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` — the same webhook the live-canary report uses —
and turns that watchdog matrix job red, so the watchdog's own run history is
the failure record. Successes post nothing, and there is no GitHub-issue
trail: the former in-run alert jobs and `nightly-alert-issue.sh` were removed
in favor of this single external check, because an in-run alert dies with its
own run on a startup_failure and can never see a cron that didn't fire.

### Main branch alerting

`main-ci-slack-alerts.yml` watches completed `workflow_run` events for the
current `push` to `main` workflows: Code Style, Tests (Reborn), Reborn E2E,
Platform & Compat, Replay Snapshot Gate, Code Coverage,
nearai-bench dispatcher tests, and Release-plz. Any watched run that concludes
`failure`, `timed_out`, `action_required`, or `startup_failure` posts a Slack
message with the workflow, conclusion, failed job names, commit, actor, and run
link.

Alerts go to `secrets.MAIN_CI_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URLS`; the value may be a single
webhook URL or multiple URLs separated by newlines or commas. This is
intentionally separate from the canary/nightly `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` so main CI
alerts can target dedicated channels.
When adding a new workflow that runs on `push` to `main`, add its workflow
`name:` to the watched list in `main-ci-slack-alerts.yml`.

## Reborn-only release validation policy

For #6160/#3483, `release.yml` temporarily keeps the legacy cargo-dist release
chain visible but disables its `plan` root with the impossible
`github.repository == ''` guard. Its dependent local/global artifact, WASM,
legacy GitHub Release host, registry-checksum, and announcement jobs therefore
skip. The Reborn compile matrix plus `publish-reborn-binaries` job is the only
intended active tag-release path.

The release Docker caller retains its own impossible guard as an explicit
defense against image publication. The reusable `docker.yml` workflow is
unchanged, so its manual and hourly entry points remain available. Changes to
the release, Docker, or reusable Reborn compile workflow enter the Reborn CLI
smoke selector, and the required Code Style roll-up propagates that contract
result. To restore the non-Docker legacy cargo-dist release path, remove
`plan`'s impossible guard and retire or reconcile the Reborn-specific publisher;
the workflow's tag-only trigger already scopes it to release tags. Restore the
Docker caller's host-success condition separately only when release image
publication is intentionally re-enabled.

## Known accepted gaps (deliberate, revisit as needed)

- **Windows clippy** (`code_style.yml` `clippy-windows`) runs on push only;
  **Windows build** (`platform-and-compat.yml` `windows-build`) runs on push
  and in the nightly deep reuse. Windows-only breakage is accepted as
  post-merge; the Linux full feature matrix catches the dominant class
  (feature-gated cfg errors).
- **Benchmark compilation** (`cargo bench --no-run`) runs on push and nightly
  only, and the clippy lanes do not pass `--benches`. Bench targets exist only
  in `crates/ironclaw_safety` today.
- **Replay Snapshot Gate** runs on push + via the nightly legacy suite; it
  covers the retiring v1 engine.
- **The legacy v1 suites are deliberately invoked nowhere** — v1 (`src/`) is
  frozen pending removal. `test.yml` (the only place the root `ironclaw`
  package's tests run) is no longer called by nightly, and the former
  `nightly-e2e.yml` scheduler for the v1 browser suite (`e2e.yml` full mode)
  is deleted — it had zero successful runs in retained history. Until `src/`
  is deleted, a v1 bug fix that must land should temporarily restore the
  `deterministic-deep-tests` call in `nightly-deep-ci.yml` (and/or dispatch
  `e2e.yml` manually). Delete `test.yml` and `e2e.yml` together with `src/`.
- **Full-path extension↔provider coverage has no scheduler on any stack**:
  the Emulate-backed full-path tests (`test_reborn_emulate_full_path.py`)
  boot the legacy binary (see `tests/e2e/CLAUDE.md`, Reborn E2E coverage
  gate) and were frozen with it. A Reborn-native port — same
  install → OAuth → tool call → provider-mutation contract through
  `ironclaw-reborn serve` — is the follow-up that restores this tier.
- **Scope classifiers** (`scripts/ci/classify-test-scope.sh` and per-workflow
  `changes` jobs) are curated allowlists. Adding a new crate or test directory
  requires updating them, or the queue's scoped checks silently narrow. Keep
  `reborn-e2e.yml`'s `changes` regex in sync with its `paths:` filters.
- **Code Coverage**, **IronClaw Stress**, live canaries, Docker/release
  pipelines are informational or post-merge; they are not merge-gating.
